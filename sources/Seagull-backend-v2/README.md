Seagull v2 is the backend of an open security operations platform, rebuilt as a
set of small processes around a durable event backbone. Telemetry becomes
durable before anything else happens to it; every capability downstream is a
consumer of that stream rather than a step inside the request that admitted it.

It is a re-architecture of [Seagull v1](https://github.com/dynasmon/Seagull), not
a port of it. v1 is the functional reference — its detection content, security
invariants and operational lessons carry over — while the layering, the queues,
the ORM-shaped domain and the synchronous telemetry path do not. Where the two
disagree, v2 wins unless there is evidence the v2 decision is wrong.

Endpoint collection is performed by an agent released independently, and the
messages the two exchange live in
[Seagull-contracts](https://github.com/dynasmon/Seagull-contracts) so that
neither repository depends on the other.

## What the backend does

### Durable telemetry ingestion

The gateway terminates mutual TLS, takes the agent's identity from the verified
certificate rather than from anything the producer sent, admits or refuses the
batch against explicit size and rate ceilings, and answers only once the
backbone owns it. An agent may drop its local copy of a batch on that answer and
on nothing else, so a gateway that crashes mid-batch costs a retry rather than
telemetry.

### Detection engineering

A rule names the class of event it reads and matches with a typed expression
over the fields of the event contract — there is no dictionary between the two,
so a rule naming a field the contract does not declare is refused where it is
written, with the line and the part that is wrong. Rules carry severity, ATT&CK
technique, false-positive guidance and provenance, and each one travels with the
cases it was written for, which the same evaluator checks.

### Sigma import

A supported Sigma rule is translated into a Seagull rule and goes through the
same validator and compiler as a rule somebody wrote here; the domain does not
know Sigma exists. What can be translated is decided by the canonical form: a
field it folds can carry Sigma's case-insensitive comparison, and a field whose
case it keeps on purpose cannot, so the comparison is refused and the remedy is
named. Everything the rule language cannot state — a pattern, a network range,
a keyword search, a distinct count, a threshold counting down — is refused with
the line it was written on rather than imported as something that runs and finds
less. A translated rule arrives as a draft carrying no cases, so two independent
gates keep it out of an estate until a person has written down what it should
find.

```bash
go run ./tools/sigmaimport -input path/to/sigma -output deploy/rules/imported.yml -strict
```

### Incidents and correlation output

Event, detection, alert and incident are four records with four owners, not four
names for one row. A detection states that a rule matched; an alert is one
detection somebody owns; an incident is what a correlation becomes when a person
has to answer for it, named by the detection that told the story and carrying one
event per stage, so it can be traced back to what it was made of. It has a
lifecycle of its own and nothing an operator does to it writes to the events or
the detection behind it. How far the platform vouches for the order a story rests
on is measured from the clocks that timed it rather than declared by the rule.

### Ruleset management

Rulesets are administered through the control plane and published to a compacted
topic, never by reaching into a running engine. A ruleset is named by its own
content, so publishing the same rules twice is one version; publishing and
activating are separate acts, so a rollout can be rolled back to a version that
cannot have changed underneath it. Nothing that fails to compile, or whose own
cases do not hold, is ever written.

### Event hunting

The query plane holds the only read connection to the store, consumes no topic
and writes nothing. A query is a scope, a window and a question, and only the
last comes from the caller: the tenants a caller may read are derived rather
than requested, so a question cannot widen its own answer.

### Access control

The control plane authenticates by certificate, exchanges a completed handshake
for a short-lived session bound to that certificate, and decides every request
against a policy of typed permissions resolved per request. A token carries
identity and no authority. Every route declares what it requires and a route
that declares nothing cannot be registered, so deny-by-default is structural.

### Agent registry and admission

The platform records what it decided about every machine it takes telemetry
from: which tenant it belongs to, what it says it is, the certificate identity
bound to it, and where it stands. Registering an agent creates it `pending`;
binding the certificate it will present makes it `active`; disabling, revoking
and decommissioning are three different endings, and the last two are final
because an identifier that came back would re-admit the certificate that was
revoked. Every change carries an actor and a reason, and the trail is
append-only.

The gateway keeps authenticating from the certificate and reads no store. What
the control plane decided crosses `security.agents`, a compacted topic keyed by
the agent: the gateway replays it before it serves, follows it afterwards, and
refuses a batch from an agent the platform stopped honouring with a map lookup
and no round trip. A decision the backbone did not take stays outstanding in the
registry and is published again until it lands. See
[ADR 24](docs/decisions/0024-an-agent-is-registered-by-the-control-plane-and-refused-by-the-gateway.md).

The tenant an agent's telemetry belongs to travels on the same record. It is the
one the agent was registered in by an operator holding that tenant, and the
gateway stamps it on every event in place of whatever the agent wrote; no
gateway-wide tenant exists. An agent the registry never named is refused rather
than placed somewhere, so one gateway serves every tenant and a routing mistake
cannot move an estate's telemetry into another's. See
[ADR 26](docs/decisions/0026-an-agent-sends-into-the-tenant-it-was-registered-in.md).

### Asset inventory

What an asset has is a record kind of its own, on a contract, a topic, a store
and a process of its own, because it is not an event: an event is one observation
and a scan is a set, and an estate reports orders of magnitude more package
observations than logins. The platform derives an item's identity rather than
reading one off the wire, so two collectors that spell a package differently
cannot leave an asset holding it twice, and an upgrade replaces the row instead
of adding one. **What an asset currently has is what its newest full scan
named**: an item that scan stopped naming is no longer current and keeps the
`last_seen` saying when it was last there, so nothing is deleted, nothing is
tombstoned, and how stale the answer is falls out of the same line. A delta
refreshes what it names and never moves that line, because it says nothing about
what it omits — and an empty scan does move it, which is how a collector says the
asset has none of that kind left. A record that reaches the store out of order
loses to the newer one it arrived behind.
[ADR 27](docs/decisions/0027-inventory-is-a-record-kind-of-its-own.md).

### Vulnerability intelligence

What is known to be wrong with software is read from its source — OSV's export
of the distributions' own advisories — by the one process that reaches the
internet, which holds no store and names no asset: what a feed says reaches the
platform as a validated advisory on the backbone and by no other way, so a feed
that fails or lies can stop nothing but that process. Every advisory says which
feed it came from, the version of that feed, the URL, when it was fetched and the
SHA-256 of the bytes, and the platform writes all of that itself. Ecosystems are
named with their release — `Debian:12`, `Ubuntu:22.04:LTS`, `Alpine:v3.19` — and an
advisory entry and an installed package are keyed by the same function, the
source package where the distribution's advisories name one, so a match is a
lookup rather than a guess; an asset the platform cannot assess says why instead
of reading as clean. **Nothing is concluded from what a feed did not say**: an
attempt that failed changes nothing and says how old the platform's copy is, an
advisory a feed stops listing is kept, and one is withdrawn only when its source
withdraws it. Every version is kept, so what was concluded from one stays
explicable. Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine, Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux are read; matching
is not built yet.
[ADR 28](docs/decisions/0028-vulnerability-intelligence-is-read-from-its-source.md).

### Storage and failure semantics

Storage is owned per workload: ClickHouse holds telemetry and detections in
tables shaped for the questions asked of each, the current state of every
asset in two more, and every version of every advisory the platform has read in
three more. A consumer advances its position
only after the work it did is durable, so a crash replays rather than skips. A
record that can never be stored is quarantined with the reason and its position,
so one poison record cannot hold up a partition.

### State, restarts and replicas

A rule that counts or orders remembers a bounded window of events, held by the
process that decided them. That state does not move with a partition, so
whenever the group hands the engine a partition — at startup and at every
rebalance — the engine is put back to the first record inside the window its
rules need and reads forward. The window is rebuilt from the stream rather than
from a checkpoint, because an observation names the event it came from and every
window is measured in event time: replaying decides the same detections, under
the same names, and counts nothing twice.

Which rules an engine may run follows from that. `security.events.raw` is keyed
by the agent, so a rule grouping by anything that includes the agent is exact at
any number of replicas, and one grouping across agents is only exact where a
single reader holds the whole stream. A deployment may declare that it does, and
the declaration is checked against what the group actually assigned it: a claim
that stops being true stops the engine rather than halving what such a rule
reports. A ruleset carrying a rule this deployment cannot answer — a window
wider than the store keeps, a threshold no key could reach, a group the stream
splits — is refused whole, and the last ruleset the process could answer keeps
running. Active means executable. See
[ADR 23](docs/decisions/0023-state-is-owned-by-the-partition-and-rebuilt-by-reading-it-back.md).

What an asset has travels beside that stream and never in it, because a
fleet-wide package scan is orders of magnitude more records than the telemetry it
arrives with, and neither may delay the other:

What is known to be wrong with software comes from outside, through the one

```

Processes are declared in [`deploy/compose.yaml`](deploy/compose.yaml):

| Process | Role |
|---|---|
| `ingest-gateway` | The only durable entry point for telemetry: identity, admission, validation, rate limiting. |
| `analysis-engine` | Reads the event stream under its own group, routes and normalises, and decides events against the ruleset it is pinned to. |
| `event-writer` | Makes admitted telemetry queryable, quarantining what it cannot store. |
| `detection-writer` | Makes a detection queryable, on the same terms and as a consumer of its own. |
| `alert-writer` | Opens the work a detection at or above a severity floor becomes: an alert for a finding about one event, folded on a declared key, or an incident for a story several events told. It inserts and never updates. |
| `inventory-projector` | Folds what a collector saw into what an asset currently has, under a group and a quarantine of its own. An item the newest full scan stops naming is no longer current, and nothing is deleted to say so. |
| `advisory-importer` | Follows the vulnerability feeds a deployment names, translates each changed record into an advisory carrying its provenance, and publishes it with the freshness of the feed. The one process that reaches the internet; it holds no store and names no asset. |
| `advisory-writer` | Keeps every version of every advisory and every attempt to follow a feed, under a group and a quarantine of its own. |
| `control-api` | The administrative surface: sessions, authorisation, ruleset validation, publication and rollback, the alert and incident lifecycles, the agent registry, and the authority that signs an agent's certificate. It is the one process terminating both trust domains — operators on its own port, and agents renewing their certificates on a second one. |
| `query-api` | The read plane, and the only reader of the analytical store. |
| `backbone-migrator`, `store-migrator`, `control-migrator` | Apply the topic topology, the analytical schema and the relational schema, then exit. Nothing migrates on the way to serving traffic. |

Dependencies point one way — `cmd` → capability → domain, with adapters plugged
in at the edges and `internal/platform` never learning about the product. That
is not a convention: [`tests/architecture`](tests/architecture) enforces it, so a
violation fails the build rather than a review.

Two capabilities never reach each other through Go. They meet on the backbone,
which is what keeps the shape of an alert table out of the thing that decides
what an alert is about.

An alert is named by the detection that raised it, so a replayed batch finds the
alert it already opened rather than opening a second one — and the process that
opens alerts never updates one, so nothing a reprocessed batch does can reach
somebody's triage. [ADR 16](docs/decisions/0016-an-alert-is-a-detection-somebody-owns.md).

Noise is removed from the alert plane and never from the detection stream:
detections that are the same piece of work fold into one alert with a count,
the estate can declare which never become work at all, and both are counted so
what was reduced is readable. The detection keeps its full evidence for 730 days
whatever happens, and an alert names every detection it is made of.
[ADR 17](docs/decisions/0017-noise-is-removed-from-the-alert-and-never-from-the-detection.md).

What a rule remembers between events is a bounded window of the backbone, keyed
by tenant, rule, revision and group, and measured in event time. State is a pure
function of the events inside its window, so a replayed batch counts once and a
restart rebuilds it by reading the window again rather than by recovering
anything. Every ceiling is declared, and a store at its limit refuses a new key
instead of evicting one: a flood of invented group values must not get to choose
which real counts an estate forgets.
[ADR 18](docs/decisions/0018-detection-state-is-a-bounded-window.md).

A rule may count what it matches: twenty failed passwords from one address
against one agent inside a minute is a different security statement from one
failed password, made of the same match. The count is part of the rule rather
than a second kind of rule, every window is event time, and the detection
carries what was counted — how many, against which threshold, over what window,
and what the events shared — so a threshold finding is not mistaken for a single
event. Nothing resets when a rule fires: past its threshold a rule decides once
per event and never more, and `deploy/alerting.yml` is where those become one
piece of work.
[ADR 19](docs/decisions/0019-a-rule-that-counts-decides-on-a-window.md).

A rule may instead order what it matches: a failed SSH password from an address,
then one from the same address that was accepted, inside five minutes, is a guess
that worked — where either event alone is unremarkable. The stages are what such
a rule matches with, so it carries a sequence or a match and never both, and the
match of each stage stays a pure function of one event while the order is read
out of the same bounded window a count is. Ordering is event time, which means
the story does not depend on the backbone delivering it in order: an event that
arrives after a later stage lands where it happened and is what completes the
story. The detection names the event that satisfied each stage, so an incident
can be traced back to the events it was made of, and it carries how far apart the
clocks that timed them stood — because ordering rests on the producer's clock,
and a story whose clocks disagree by more than it lasted is one the data does not
order.
[ADR 20](docs/decisions/0020-a-sequence-is-decided-by-the-window-that-holds-it.md).

A story that several events tell is a different piece of work from a finding
about one of them, so a detection carrying a correlation opens an incident and
never an alert. It is named by that detection the way an alert is named by the
one that raised it, so a replay finds the story it already opened; it carries one
event per stage and the group that made them one story, so the trace to its
component events and detection is on the record rather than in a join; and it has
a lifecycle of its own, granted separately, whose moves never touch what the
analysis engine wrote. How far the order can be trusted is a measurement rather
than a number somebody tuned: the spread of the clocks that timed the story,
against its own span and against the window the rule looked through.
[ADR 21](docs/decisions/0021-an-incident-is-a-correlation-somebody-owns.md).

Sigma is a language this platform reads and never becomes. A Sigma document is
translated into a `detection.Rule` by an adapter and compiled by the same door
every rule file goes through, so an imported rule cannot be a second way into the
engine. What survives translation is bounded by the canonical form rather than by
a table of aliases: Sigma compares without case and the rule language compares
with it, so a comparison translates only where normalisation already removed the
difference, and where it deliberately did not — an account name, because case is
meaning on a Unix host — the comparison is refused and Sigma's own `|cased`
modifier is the way to ask for what the platform can actually answer. v1 answered
the same question by rewriting what it could not read into an inert placeholder,
so an unsupported rule imported cleanly, compiled and quietly found nothing.
[ADR 22](docs/decisions/0022-sigma-is-translated-and-never-adopted.md).

## Getting started

Requires Docker with the Compose plugin and Go 1.25.

```bash
make dev-pki    # mint a development CA, server, agent and caller certificates
make up         # build the images and start the backbone, the store and every process
make verify     # the full gate: lint, module graph, tests, race detector
```

`make up` writes nothing outside the repository and reads nothing that is not in
it; the development material lands in `.local/pki`, which Git ignores.

Send a batch through the running gateway, then ask the query plane what became
of it. The probe first registers the development agent in the `default` tenant as
`dev-admin`, because the gateway admits only an agent the registry placed in a
tenant; `-register ""` skips that step:

```bash
go run ./tools/devprobe -endpoint https://127.0.0.1:8443
go run ./tools/devprobe -hunt https://127.0.0.1:8444
```

Send what an asset has — a distribution, a package list and a service — and watch
it become the current state of that asset:

```bash
go run ./tools/devprobe -inventory
```

The development stack follows Debian's advisories; another distribution is one
variable away, `SEAGULL_ADVISORY_FEEDS=Alpine make up`. How fresh the platform's
copy of each feed is, read from the store:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml exec clickhouse clickhouse-client --user seagull -d seagull -q \
  "SELECT feed, argMax(outcome, checked_at), argMax(synced_at, checked_at), argMax(held, checked_at)
   FROM vulnerability_feed_syncs GROUP BY feed"
```

Register an agent, have the platform sign the certificate it will present, watch
it renew that certificate itself, and revoke it:

```bash
go run ./tools/devprobe -agents https://127.0.0.1:8445 -renewals https://127.0.0.1:8446
```

Stop everything and drop its state with `make down`. If a port is taken, publish
elsewhere with `SEAGULL_GATEWAY_PUBLISH`, `SEAGULL_QUERY_API_PUBLISH`,
`SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_PUBLISH` or `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_RENEWAL_PUBLISH`.

## Configuration

Every setting is an environment variable, typed, validated at startup, and
reported all at once when something is wrong. Any variable can be read from a
file instead by adding the `_FILE` suffix, which is how secrets reach a
container without going through the environment. The settings that matter most:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_BROKERS` | The event backbone every process depends on. |
| `SEAGULL_GATEWAY_TLS_CERT`, `SEAGULL_GATEWAY_TLS_KEY`, `SEAGULL_GATEWAY_AGENT_CA` | The gateway's mutual TLS material; there is no plaintext mode. |
| `SEAGULL_DETECTION_RULES` | The rule tree the engine starts on and falls back to. |
| `SEAGULL_DETECTION_STATE_WINDOW`, `SEAGULL_DETECTION_STATE_OBSERVATIONS`, `SEAGULL_DETECTION_STATE_KEYS` | What a counting or ordering rule may remember: the longest window, the events one key holds, and how many keys at once. The window is also what a restart re-reads. |
| `SEAGULL_DETECTION_STATE_SOLE_READER` | Declares that this engine reads the whole stream, which is what makes a rule counting across agents answerable. Verified against the assignment; a broken claim stops the engine. |
| `SEAGULL_GATEWAY_MAX_INFLIGHT_BYTES`, `SEAGULL_GATEWAY_MAX_INFLIGHT_REQUESTS` | What the gateway holds at once across every caller. Past it a batch is refused with `503` and `Retry-After`, never queued. |
| `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_TLS`, `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_TLS_CA`, `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_SASL_MECHANISM`, `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_SASL_USER`, `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_SASL_PASSWORD` | How every process reaches the backbone. Off is a development posture stated rather than inherited; authenticating without TLS is refused. |
| `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_REPLICAS`, `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_MIN_INSYNC_REPLICAS` | How many copies of a record the backbone keeps and how many must be in sync to acknowledge one. Acknowledging on every in-sync replica means nothing when one replica is in sync. |
| `SEAGULL_EVENT_STORE_TLS`, `SEAGULL_EVENT_STORE_TLS_CA` | Encryption to the telemetry store. There is no option to skip verification. |
| `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_POLICY` | The policy document the control plane is pinned to. |
| `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_AGENT_AUTHORITY_CERT`, `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_AGENT_AUTHORITY_KEY` | The authority the control plane signs agent certificates with. Read once at startup; a plane that cannot read it does not serve. |
| `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_AGENT_TRUST_BUNDLE` | Every authority an agent is told to trust, read at each issuance and sent with the certificate. Widening it is how a certificate authority is rotated without visiting a machine; an authority that signs and is not in it is refused. |
| `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_AGENT_CERT_LIFETIME` | How long an issued agent certificate is valid. Short is the answer to a stolen key nobody has revoked, and renewal is what makes short affordable. |
| `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_RENEWAL_ADDRESS`, `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_RENEWAL_TLS_CERT`, `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_RENEWAL_TLS_KEY`, `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_AGENT_CA` | The agent-facing listener an agent renews on, in the agent trust domain rather than the operator one. |
| `SEAGULL_BACKBONE_AGENTS_TOPIC` | Where the control plane says what it decided about an agent and the gateway reads it. Compacted, keyed by the agent. |
| `SEAGULL_CONTROL_TELEMETRY_STORE_ADDRESS` | Where the control plane reads when an agent was last heard from. It writes nothing there. |
| `SEAGULL_CONTROL_API_SESSION_KEY` | Key sessions are signed with; drawn at random when unset. |
| `SEAGULL_EVENT_STORE_ADDRESS`, `SEAGULL_EVENT_STORE_PASSWORD` | The telemetry store and its credentials. |
| `SEAGULL_ADVISORY_FEEDS` | The distributions whose advisories the platform reads — any of `Debian`, `Ubuntu`, `Alpine`, `Rocky Linux`, `AlmaLinux`. Required, because the first read of a feed is its whole index; the development stack names `Debian`. |
| `SEAGULL_ADVISORY_OSV_EXPORT`, `SEAGULL_ADVISORY_OSV_CA` | Where the advisories are read from — OSV's public export, or a mirror laid out the same way — and the authority a mirror is signed by. https only; there is no plaintext mode. |

[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) lists every setting each
process reads, along with the acknowledgement contract, the topic topology and
the shape of the store.

## Tests

```bash
make test              # unit, architecture and end-to-end suites
make test-race         # the same suites under the race detector
make test-integration  # the data plane against a live Redpanda and ClickHouse
make test-load         # the ingest load scenarios against a live Redpanda
make bench             # the hot path, one core, no infrastructure
```

The integration suite includes the failure scenarios the guarantees rest on: a
restart in the middle of an active window, the same restart without the read
back so the assertion cannot pass for another reason, a partition moving to a
second replica while three agents are being counted, and a reader losing the
whole stream it claimed. The end-to-end suite mints its own certificate
authority and drives the real listeners over real mutual TLS, so it depends on no fixture files and no
property of the machine it runs on. The integration suite ends with the whole
slice — admission, backbone, writer, store — against real infrastructure, which
is what the rest of it is a decomposition of. The load suite fails a run when
the gateway allocates more than 8 KB per admitted event, when a slow backbone
produces an acknowledgement the backbone never received, or when a shutdown
drops a batch it had already answered for.

Vulnerability matching and response actions are not implemented — advisories are
read and kept, and nothing compares them with an asset yet — no collector sends
inventory yet — `tools/devprobe -inventory` is the only producer — and
Sigma import covers one class of event. Detection is stateless unless a rule asks
otherwise: a rule that counts or orders its events reads a bounded window of the
backbone in event time, which is what keeps both replayable.
